# The Witcher 3 Complete Edition (NextGen) Widescreen Cutscenes Patcher

Convenient way to quickly remove black bars from **The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt** after the NextGen update. The application modifies game executables allowing you to watch cutscenes in full ultrawide resolution for 21:9 monitors.

## How to?

Place the **w3ws.exe** in the root directory of the game, or wherever you want. Maybe it will find it automatically...

## Compilation

Use Visual Studio 2022 and invoke the .sln.
